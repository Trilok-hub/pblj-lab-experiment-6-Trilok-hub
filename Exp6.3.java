To develop a Java program that processes a large dataset of products using Streams class to:
  - Group products by category
  - Find the most expensive product in each category
  - Calculate the average price of all products


Instruction
Step 1: Create the Product Class
- Define a Product class with attributes:
    name (String)
    category (String)
    price (double)
  
or (Reads product data from a CSV file)
For Example: "Laptop", "Electronics", 1200
             "Phone", "Electronics", 800


Step 2: Create the ProductProcessor Class
- Create a list of products with multiple categories and prices.
- Use Streams API to:
    Group products by category using Collectors.groupingBy().
    Find the most expensive product in each category using Collectors.maxBy().
    Calculate the average price of all products using Collectors.averagingDouble().
- Display the results.


  
    Test Cases
    Test Case	                                     Input Data	                                                                           Expected Output
    Case 1: Normal Case             	     Sample dataset with Electronics, Clothing, and Footwear	                      Grouped products, Most Expensive per category, Average price
    Case 2: Single Category Only           All products in "Electronics"	                                                One category, Most Expensive in Electronics, Average of all
    Case 3: Same Price in a Category	     Two products with the same highest price in "Footwear"	                        Any of the most expensive ones is displayed
    Case 4: Only One Product	             One product "Laptop" in "Electronics"	                                        Laptop as the most expensive, Laptop as the only average
    Case 5: Empty List	                   No products	                                                                  No grouping, No most expensive product, Average price = 0
